## Table of contents
A brief desciption of all the different programs are as follows:
1. matmul: Implementing a 2-D matrix multiplier without using the numpy library 
2. spicesim: Simulating a SPICE circuit solver with netlist inputs
3. estimateparam: Use curve fitting to estimate physical constants from radiation spectrum data
4. typinganalysis: Plotting heat patterns for typed data and analysing the finger travel distance as a measure of keyboard layout cost for a specified layout
5. keyboardoptim: Optimally arranging keys on a keyboard to minimise travel distance using simualted annealing
6. cythonise: Using cython to speed up numeric computation
7. soundloc: Using the delay and sum algorithm to locate a sound source with a given microphone array data
